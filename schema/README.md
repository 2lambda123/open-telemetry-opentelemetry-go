# Telemetry Schema Files

The `schema` module contains packages that help to parse and validate
[schema files](https://github.com/open-telemetry/oteps/blob/main/text/0152-telemetry-schemas.md).

Each `major.minor` schema file format version is implemented as a separate package, with
the name of the package in the `vmajor.minor` form.
