# OpenTelemetry Collector Traces Example
This example is to just export OTLP to a collector running locally (via Docker) and print the trace data to stdout.
# Running the code
```
sh build.sh  
go run main.go
```
Now you can check the trace data generated by `main.go` on the terminal where you type `sh build.sh`.
